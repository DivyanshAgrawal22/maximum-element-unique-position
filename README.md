# maximum-element-unique-position
This is a Python program to print the maximum element in each row in an array at unique positions. Suppose in a 3x3 array, the maximum element in the first row is at the position 2 (indexing starting from 1), the other rows can't select the maximum on position 2 even if it is the maximum in that row.
